	"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside",
	"I'm not one of those who can easily hide",
	"I don't have much money, but boy if I did",

	"v1:",
	"If I was a sculptor, but then again, no",
	"Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show",

	"And you can tell everybody this is your song",
	"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done",
